Hello,

We are a collaborative blog of 4 teenage girls, every week you can find four new blog posts by us. There will be an alternating theme system (kinda thing) so every other week there will be a theme that each person will create a post based on (Feel free to send requests for upcoming themes!). In the weeks in-between there will be no theme, so each person can write about what they want. 

Our blog doesn't have a specific subject so you can hope to see all manner of different subjects, and hopefully one will tickle your fancy! Some categories that we are hoping to write about are: beauty, books, food, life and maybe some DIY projects too.

So please stick around and see what you think!

- F.I.L.M
